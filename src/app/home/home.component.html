            <h1>Teacher <br><span></span>Management <br>System</h1>
            <p class="par">Teachers are at the heart of the learning process. They strongly influence both the quality of education that children receive at school and eventually their learning outcomes. Effective teacher management is therefore essential to the success of any education system. Cost-efficient teacher management is even more important given the fact that teachers account for a significant share of civil service staff and that their wage bill represents over two thirds of public education spending in most countries.</p>
